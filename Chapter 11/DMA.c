/* Dynamic Memory Allocation
It is a way to allocate memory to a data structure during the runtime/

We need some functions to allocate and free memory dynamically.

Function for DMA:
1. malloc()     --> Memory allocation
2. calloc()     --> Continuous allocation
3. free()       --> Free allocation
4. realloc()    --> Re-allocation
